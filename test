2 Information technology in a business environment
1. For each of the descriptions below, identify the concept that is being defined:
• A structured set of activities, executed in an organization:
business process
• A simple action, normally part of a business process:
activity
• A collection of related business processes:
business function
• A sequence of business functions via which business processes are sequenced to produce products or
services with added value:
value chain
• Those functions in the Porter Value chain model that directly producing added value:
primary activities
• Those functions in the Porter Value chain model ensure that the primary activities can run smoothly:
support activities
• The extension of the value chain over several organizations:
value system
• The system of organizations and activities from raw materials to finished goods:
supply chain
• A single system for the creation, storage, management and processing of data:
computer system
• A collection of equipment, services and human effort supporting the creation, storage, management and
processing of information:
information system
• Supporting individual business processes by the storage and processing of their data:
data processing
• Using information systems to make the execution of groups of related business processes more efficient:
task automation
• Automating complete business processes along the value chain of an organization:
integrated information systems
2. Explain what business processes, activities and business functions are. Give and discuss an
example of each.
A business process is a structured set of activities executed in an organization. It needs time, space, and
resources. A business process can be composed of other business processes and activities.
An activity is a simple action, and can be composed of sub-activities. An elementary activity is an activity that
cannot be split in sub-activities.
A business function is a collection of related business processes.
Examples in book, Figure 2.1, pages 16-17.
3. Describe the value chain model of Michael Porter.
Primary activities contribute directly to the added value of the products
• inbound logistics: contains activities such as the receipt, storage and distribution of raw materials
• operations: includes the actual production: the conversion of raw materials into finished products
1
• outbound logistics: processes bringing the finished products to the customers: storage, transportation and
order processing
• marketing and sales: includes processes such as promotion, pricing, the making of offers and sales
transactions
• service: groups the post-sales activities: support, installation, repairs and training
Support activities ensure that the primary activities can run smoothly
• firm infrastructure: includes acquisition and management of the firm infrastructure needed to keep the
organization operational
• human resources management: processes of selection, hiring and management of employees
• technology development: processes enable acquisition of necessary knowledge and competences
• procurement: includes acquisition of resources to execute the business process
Margin is the difference between total value of products of the organization and total cost of primary and
support activities
Figure 1: The value chain according to Michael Porter.
4. Describe how value chains are integrated into value systems and into the supply chain.
A value chain is a sequence of business functions via which business processes are sequenced to produce products
or services with added value. A value system is an extended value chain crated by interconnecting value chains
of different organizations. A supply chain is a complete system of organizations and resources to convert raw
materials into finished products; it often contains several linked value systems and value chains.
5. Describe three ways to use information systems in businesses. What are the main differences
between these ways to use information systems?
1. data processing
indivicual business processes are supported by storage and processing of data
only isolated business processes or small groups of business processes are involved
2. task automation
information systems are used to make execution of business processes and groups of related business
processes more efficient
3. integrated information systems
automate complete business processes along value chain of the organization and along value systems
interconnecting several organizations
2
6. Describe the properties of integrated information systems. How are these properties different
from task automation?
• integration
different parts of the system are designed to work together
• adjustment of the business processes to information systems
sometimes business processes are modified to align them in the way in which the information system
handles them
• complex systems
implement and use complex information systems, containing several computer systems, running specific
and complex software, and interconnected by networks
7. Discuss the attention points and issues when implementing integrated information systems.
Which of these issues are also important for the implementation of task automation?
• structured approach
• consider the whole organizations
• a vision
• an architecture
• change
• several phases
• not only IT specialists
8. Explain why the introduction of integrated information systems requires a way of thinking
that differs from the thinking of the “traditional” technically oriented IT specialist.
The most important problems encountered during the introduction of integrated information systems are
not technical. Rather, one is confronted with ever-changing user requirements, severe budget limitations,
unmotivated staff and unacceptable project delays.
9. Discuss the benefits of the use of information systems.
1. operational benefits
2. tactical benefits
3. strategic benefits
10. What is the difference between quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits when using information
systems? Give an example of each type of benefit of the use of information systems.
quantifiable benefits represent an amount of money → can usually be estimated
non-quantifiable benefits cannot/can hardly be explained in terms of money
11. Many consider information technology as a commodity. Why is that?
IR resources are a commodity. IT capabilities not.
Competing enterprises may acquire and use the same information systems. Therefore they may all enjoy the
benefits in the same way, and therefore it is impossible to develop a competitive advantage by using information
technology.
3
12. Explain how the use of information technology may lead to a competitive advantage, even
when IT resources are commodities.
The IT capabilities are the way an organizations uses the IT resources. It is necessary to select the appropriate
resources, to use them in a correct and efficient way, and to manage them properly. Organizations cannot make
a difference with their IT resources, but the can make a difference by developing advanced IT capabilities, for
instance by implementing the most appropriate integrated information systems.

basic services
• Services, offered to end users in addition to the end-user services
extra services
• The end user service, providing desktop systems, laptops, tablets, and smartphones to end users
desktop services

outsourcing
• A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable
resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with a minimal effort or service interaction
cloud computing
• The cloud computing model offering only processing, storage and network capacity to the user
infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
8
• The cloud computing model where the provider supplies additional system software and supporting
software on top of processing, storage and network capacity
platform as a service (PaaS)
• This ITIL process balances the need for IT services against the available supply
service strategy
• The purpose of this ITIL process is to deploy sufficient IT resources in order to deliver the required IT
services at the agreed service levels
service transition
• This ITIL process supports the building, testing and roll-out of the IT services
service transition
• In ITIL, this is an unplanned interruption of an IT service or a significant reduction of the quality of an
IT service
incident
• The ITIL process granting users the right to use a particular IT service
service operation
• This component of IT4IT provides a standard and repeatable model for creating an IT services management
environment
IT value chain
• In this CMMI-SVC maturity level, processes are unstable and ad hoc
initial
• Starting from this CMMI-SVC maturity level, selected key processes are institutionalized. People are
assigned responsibility and are trained
managed
• Starting from this CMMI-SVC maturity level, quality and performance are statistically defined and
managed
quantitatively managed
2. Explain what IT services are and what the basic principles of IT services provision are.
An IT service is a service that delivers value to users trough use of IT systems. Basic principles of IT services
provision:
• services catalog
• each service has “unit of consumption” = service unit
• users (“customers”) and IT department (“supplier”) enter agreements on minimal quality of service, called
service levels → mutual agreement on service levels := service level agreements
3. Describe what efficiency and effectiveness of IT services is and what the difference between
these two service properties is.
A service is effective when it provides the right functionality to the user. A service is efficient when it has
sufficient capacity and performance to allow it to be used without causing unwanted delays or other worries.
4. Describe the three types of IT services. Give an example of each.
1. End-user services: services, offered and used by the end users; end-user services can contain basic services
and can be “augmented” by extra services
2. Basic services: services that are needed to implement end-user services
3. Extra services: services offered to end users in addition to the end-user services; the enhance the value of
the end-user service
9
5. Describe the six classes of IT services. Give an example of each.
• Desktop services
• Storage
• Printing
• Network and Internet
• Application services
– Application usage
– Application development
• Support services
– Assistance
– Maintenance and repair
6. Why is it a good idea to bundle support services with their corresponding end-user service?
Bundling support with all services spreads the (inevitable) support cost over more users and more services.
7. What are the two options for choosing a service unit for an IT service? Discuss the advantages
and disadvantages of each. For each option, give an example of an IT service that has this service
unit.
• Subscription service units
+ Simple to keep track of users
- Cost not uniformly proportional to use
e.g.: desktop PC service [/PC /month]
• Volume service units
+ Pay for what you use, no more, no less
- Measuring volume is (almost) always difficult
- Volumes are difficult to forecast (budgeting, cost calculation)
e.g.: Storage [Gbyte/day]
e.g.: Printing [page]
8. Discuss the options to locate (“source”) the IT department in a large organization. Discuss
the advantages and risks of each approach.
• one shared central IT department for the whole organization
+ economies of scale
+ high degree of standardization
+ ample room for development of new capabilities and new services
- ineffective IT services
- IT is far from business
- Lack of flexibility
• one separate UT departmen per division
+ customer intimacy
+ opportunity to specialize in IT services and infrastructure relevant to local business
- high cost of IT
- IT not managed closely enough
• hybrid model
10
9. Explain what outsourcing is. What are the main reasons why an organization chooses for
outsourcing?
Outsourcing is contracting out part of the IT services to one or more specialized external companies.
Main reasons:
• organization wants to focus on its key competences
• insufficient IT competences present within the organization
• cost reduction
• better service
10. Organizations can outsource different aspects of their IT. Describe the different possibilities,
each leading to a different “kind” of outsourcing.
• complete outsourcing
• outsourcing of system support
• outsourcing of servers
• outsourcing of application
• desktop outsourcing
11. Why should organizations always consider outsourcing with the utmost care?
Once IT services are outsourced, the organization no longer has any direct control over the internal details of
the IT services provision, as these are under the control of the external service provider.
12. Define what cloud computing is.
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool
of configurable resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with a minimal effort or service interaction.
13. Describe the main characteristics of cloud computing.
• Flexible on demand service
• Metered use
• Universal access
14. Describe the three service models for cloud computing. Start with the most limited service
and end with the most complete service model.

• Platform as a Service (PaaS)
• Software as a Service (SaaS)
15. Describe the four ways a provider can offer cloud services to customers.
• Public cloud
• Private cloud
• Community cloud

2. Service design: aspects of the design of IT services: general principles, the identification of the requirements,
the services catalog management and the service level management
3. Service transition: guidelines on the roll-out of IT services
4. Service operation: daily operations of IT services
5. Continual service improvements (CSI): principles and processes involved in improving the IT services
19. What are the processes of the service strategy phase?

• Business relationship management
20. Describe the ITIL-2011 service design. What is described in this ITIL book? What are the
processes of the service design phase?
• Service catalog management
• Service level management
• Capacity management
• Availability management
• IT Services continuity management
• Information security management
• Supplier management
• Design coordination
21. Describe the ITIL-2011 service transition. What is described in this ITIL book? What are
the processes of the service transition phase?
• Transition planning and support
• Change management
12
• Service asset and configuration management
• Release and deployment management
• Service validation and testing

• Request fulfillment
• Problem management
• Access management
23. Describe the ITIL-2011 continual service improvement activities. What is described in this
ITIL book? What are the processes of continual service improvement?
• Service improvement
• Service measurement
• Service reporting
24. To which ITIL-2011 life cycle phase does each of these processes belong:
• Service level management: service design
• Change management: service transition
• Demand management: service strategy
• Incident management: service operation
• Access management: service operation
25. What is the purpose of ITIL Service portfolio management?
The objective of ITIL Service Portfolio Management is to manage the service portfolio. This ITIL process ensures
that the service provider has the right mix of services to meet required business outcomes at an appropriate
level of investment.
26. Briefly describe ITIL IT Service continuity management.
IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM) aims to manage risks that could seriously impact IT services.
This ITIL process ensures that the IT service provider can always provide minimum agreed Service Levels,
by reducing the risk from disaster events to an acceptable level and planning for the recovery of IT services.
ITSCM should be designed to support Business Continuity Management.
27. What is the difference between ITIL demand management and ITIL capacity management?
ITIL Demand Management aims to understand, anticipate and influence customer demand for services. This
process works with Capacity Management to ensure that the service provider has sufficient capacity to meet
the required demand for particular services.
ITIL Capacity Management aims to ensure that the capacity of IT services and the IT infrastructure is able
13
to deliver the agreed service level targets in a cost effective and timely manner. The Capacity Management
process considers all resources required to deliver the IT service, and plans for short, medium and long term
business requirements.
28. Briefly describe the main parts of the ISO/IEC 20000 standard.
• part 1: service management systems requirements
• part 2: guidance on the application of service management systems
• part 4: process reference model
• part 5: exemplar implementation plan for ISO/IEC 20000-1
29. Is the ISO/IEC 20000 standard descriptive or prescriptive? Explain what you mean by your
answer.
ISO/IEC 20000 is a prescriptive standard. It tells you what you must do in order to be compliant with the
standard. if you fail to implement everything the way described in the standard, you are not compliant. In
addition, ISO/IEC 20000 contains strict requirements for compliance. These are auditable, so an auditor can
use the requirements to verify whether your organization is compliant or not.
30. How does the ISO/IEC 20000 standard relate to the ITIL standard? What are differences
and the commonalities?
ITIL is more elaborate than the ISO/IEC 20000 standard. The most general description of IT management is
contained in the first part of the ISO/IEC 20000 standard (Service management systems requirements). More
details and implementation guidelines are given in the rest of the standard. Still more details are contained in
the ITIL books.
An organization implementing ITIL can easily become ISO/IEC 20000 certified, as only minor changes in the
processes are needed to become compliant with the ISO/IEC standard.
31. Explain the difference between “ITIL-certified” and “ISO/IEC 20000-certified”.
There is no formal independent third party compliance assessment available for ITIL compliance in an organization.
Certification in ITIL is only available to individuals.
32. The IT4IT standard uses a different approach to the description of IT management; which
approach is that?
The IT4IT standard approaches IT services management from the stance of the supply chain. The standard
defines a general framework for IT management, mainly based on functionality and data necessary to implement
IT services management. The standard is intended to be independent of technology, vendors and specific
methodologies.
33. Briefly describe the activities in the IT4IT value chain.
• finance and assets
• sourcing and vendor
• intelligence and reporting
• resource and project
• governance, risk and compliance
34. What are the five levels of abstraction at which the IT4IT reference architecture is defined?
1. end-to-end overview
14
2. value stream documentation
3. vendor-independent architecture
4. vendor-specific refinement architecture
5. solution architecture
35. Why can you also consider COBIT (a standard for IT governance) as an IT management
standard?
COBIT has 5 governance and 32 management processes.
36. What are the four capability levels defined by CMMI-SVC?
1. Incomplete
2. Performed
3. Managed
4. Defined
37. What are the five maturity levels of CMMI-SVC?
1. Initial
2. Managed
3. Defined
4. Quantitatively managed
5. Optimized
38. What is the difference between the capability levels and the maturity levels in CMMI-SVC?
Capability levels consider single process area, while maturity levels consider organization’s overall performance.
39. What are the differences between the “defined” and the “quantitatively managed” maturity
level in CMMI-SVC?
Defined:
• Implementation best practices (service continuity, incident handling)
• Processes rigorously defined and described
• Establishment consistent standard processes (variants in particular circumstances)
• Proactive process management
Quantitatively managed:
• Quantitative measurement of process objectives and performance
• Objectives based on customer requirements
• Quality, performance statistically defined and managed
• Process performance is predictable and consistent
15
14 Services delivery management
1. For each of the descriptions below, identify the concept that is being defined:
• The document containing the description of the services, offered by the IT department
service catalog
• A document where an end user expresses the desire to receive an IT service from the IT services provider
customer service request
• The fact that the cost of IT resources or IT services per unit lowers as more units are being deployed
economies of scale
• The scaling law in which the total cost is proportional to the square root of the total capacity. It was
originally observed at the end of the 1940’s and held up for mainframe servers in the 1950’s and early
1960’s.
Grosch’s law
• The observed relation that the number of transistors on a single clip doubles each 18 to 24 months
Moore’s law
2. Describe the contents of the service catalog.
• description of overall services strategy
• summary of available and planned services
• terms and conditions for request and delivery of services
• standard service level agreement
• for each service:
– name of service
– version of service
– description of service
– offered service levels
– groups of users for whom service is intended
– service unit(s) and service pricing
– service prerequisites
– specific terms and condition for requesting service
3. Why is it a good idea to use the same service units for all variants of one service?
It makes the switch to another variant easier.
4. Who handles service requests?
The IT services manager.
5. Describe activities of handling and fulfilling IT service requests.
1. Request is submitted by the customer
2. Request is registered in customer service request database
3. Request is evaluated
4. Request is approved
16
6. What is the difference between a simple and a complex service request?
A simple request is immediately progressed to approval. The customer is not informed of financial consequences.
It is assumed that the customer consulted the service catalog for the financial consequences.
A complex request is examined in more detail. The customer is explicitly informed of the financial consequences
of the service.
7. Describe the parameters and the issues to consider when evaluating a complex service request.
• urgency
• resources needed for delivery or activation of service
• estimated lead time for implementation
• financial consequences for customer
• financial consequences for IT department
8. Describe the three necessary conditions for approving a service request.
• user receiving services should be authorized
• customer should have authorization to engage in eventual extra cost
• IT department has authorization to spend extra cost
9. Describe the three levels at which we make IT services forecasts.
• business processes
• services consumption
• resources
10. Describe the two main techniques for obtaining useful forecasts of IT services usage. Is each
of these techniques applicable to each of the three levels? Why (not)?
• user forecasts → not always reliable; good at capturing large changes → applicable to business processes
and services consumption
• trend analysis → usually reliable; show real evolution; cannot detect large changes → applicable to services
consumption and resources
11. Why are user forecasts not always reliable? What can be done about this?
Reliable forecasts usually a combination of user forecasts and trend analysis: “zeroth-order” forecast by trend
analysis and user forecasts used to capture exception changes in business.
12. What do we mean by “economy of scale”?
The cost of a single resource/service/. . . decreases when the amount of resources/services/. . . increases.
13. What are five common patterns of capacity – cost relationships, found in IT resources?
Briefly describe each pattern. Give an example of each pattern.
• linear scaling, e.g.: development effort
• linear scaling with upfront cost, e.g.: large-capacity storage systems
• stepped cost, e.g.: network connections
• fixed cost, e.g.: much application software
17
• Grosch’s law, e.g.: some computer hardware
14. Explain why linear scaling with upfront cost effectively leads to economies of scale while
linear scaling does not.
The upfront cost is divided among the capacity to get a cost per item/resource. When only one item/resource
is purchased, the entire upfront cost is assigned to that item/resource. When a hundred items/resources are
purchased, only 0.01 of the upfront cost is assigned to each item/resource, making the cost per item/resource
smaller.
15 Financial management
1. For each of the descriptions below, identify the concept that is being defined:
• A (future) cash flow, not corrected for inflation
real cash flows
• A (future) cash flow, corrected for inflation
nominal cash flows
• The interest rate for which the net present value of a series of cash flows is zero
nominal interest rate
• The result of a cost calculation, based on budgeted costs and forecasted service volumes
standard cost
• The result of a cost calculation, based on real expended costs and real consumed service volumes
actual cost
• Logical combinations of hardware, software, services and human resources supporting the delivery of
services to the customers, used as intermediary in IT services cost calculation
list of resources
• The principle of letting users pay for the use of IT services
charge-out
2. Describe the three steps in performing a cost-benefit analysis of an IT project.
1. determine costs
2. determine benefits
3. compare costs and benefits
3. How are the costs and the benefits compared to each other in an IT cost-benefit analysis?
They are compared per year over useful lifetime. A positive cash flow is used for the benefits, and a negative for
the costs. It usually is negative at the start (development) and positive during operations (benefits realization).
The net present value 
NP V =
X
N
n=0
CFn
(1 + i)
n
!
is used for the calculations.
4. Explain the difference between real cash flows and nominal cash flows.
Real cash flows (current cash flows) are not corrected for inflation.
Nominal interest rate = real interest rate (i = r)
Nominal cash flows (money cash flows) are corrected for inflation.
Nominal interest rate = 1 + i = (1 + r)(1 + h) with r real rate, h inflation rate; in practice: i ≈ r + h

5. Why is the direct allocation of costs to services to calculate the IT services cost in practice
unfeasible? Support your answer with a reasonable example.
For N items and M services, N × M numbers should be calculated. Therefore it is better to allocate costs to
resources and then to services.
6. What is the role of the “resources” in an IT cost calculation and why do we need them?
Resources are an intermediate step in cost calculation. Instead of assigning the costs immediately to the services,
the costs are assigned to the resources. When the cost of the resources is calculated, the resource costs can be
assigned to the services using that resource.
7. Give guidelines for the definition of resources in IT cost calculation and also give examples of
good resources.
A resource is a logical combination of hardware, software, personnel and services. The resources should be
complete (include all costs). More resources = more granular cost info = more cost calculation effort.
8. How do we consolidate the personnel costs in an IT cost calculation? What different options
are there to do the consolidation? What are the advantages of each option?
Structure the personnel costs and determine the cost per operational staff member. These costs can be directly
assigned to one or more resource(s).
Different options:
•
total staff cost
# operational staff members
• cost per individual staff member
•
cost per group of similar staff members
# operational staff members per group
9. During one fiscal year, when would you calculate the standard cost of IT services and when
would you calculate the actual cost?
The standard cost is calculated at the start of the fiscal year, and the actual cost at the end of the fiscal year.
10. Why would you group service variants? What are the criteria to group variants of services
in the cost calculation?
Grouping related services avoids too much detail and creates cost differentiation within group.
criteria:
• Same service, different service level
• Same service, different capacity
• Different service, essentially identical
• Different service, same resources
11. What are the main considerations when determining the number of different resources to
define in a cost calculation? (what are the advantages of defining a larger number of resources,
what are the advantages of defining a smaller number of resources)?
It should be easy to assign each cost to resource and to assign each resource to service. The resources should
be complete (include all costs).
More resources → more granular cost info → more cost calculation effort
19
12. Describe the mechanism to allocate the costs to the resources and to determine the total
cost of the resources.
Assignments based on:
• Inventory (e.g. depreciation of equipment, part of resource)
• Contract (e.g. license of software, part of resource)
• Staff function (e.g. operational staff, supporting resource)
• Ad-hoc decision (estimate)
total cost of resource = P cost × allocation
13. Describe the mechanism to allocate the resources to the IT services and to determine the
cost of the services.
Assignments based on:
• Use of resource (e.g. firewall, used for internet access service)
• Staff allocation (e.g. programmers doing development or maintenance)
• Ad-hoc decision (estimate)
total cost service = P cost × allocation
14. Describe how to calculate the unit cost of the IT services from the total cost of each service.
Especially explain how to proceed if there are service variants that should be allocated a different
unit cost.
services unit cost = total service cost / number of service units
For service variants:
Give each variant (l) of a service k a weight fkl (#variants: Tk)
Nkl is the number of units of variant l of service k
Then:
Total effective service units of service k: Uk =
PTk
l=1 fkl.Nkl
Cost of unit weight (f = 1) of service unit k: S
(U)
k = Sk/Uk
Unit cost of variant l of service k: S
(U)
kl = fklS
(U)
k =
fkl.Sk
Uk
15. Explain how the cost calculation can be summarized using matrix calculation. Why is this
calculation so useful?
16. Describe the general principles of charge-out.
• understandable
• fair
• predictable
• verifiable
• consistent
17. Describe the three steps to set up an internal charge-out system. Also give a few guiding
principles to obtain a good internal charge-out system.
Charge-out steps:
1. Define services
20
2. Cost calculation
3. Charge out consumed services
Guiding principles:
• Do not over-recover from users (=set IT services prices too high)
• Do not under-recover from users (=set IT services prices too low)
18. How can the differences between the total actual IT cost and the total charge-out be handled?
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each option.
• Customers pay more than actual cost
• Company has excessive overhead costs to cover the higher actual cost
19. Why is it a bad idea to systematically and severely over-charge users for their IT services?
IT costs for users are too high. The company products and services are overprices. This leads to a loss of
competitiveness because the offers are priced too high.
20. Why is it a bad idea to systematically and severely under-charge users for their IT services?
IT costs for users are too low which lead to excess IT costs as overhead. The company products and services
are underprices which leads to loss of profitability because profit erosion occurs by excessive overhead costs.
21. What are three good practices to obtain useful forecasts of IT services consumption?
Forecasts from different sources:
• customer surveys
• historic trends
• particular changes in enterprise
22. What are good practices to monitor the consumption of volume-based IT services?
• measure volumes by constant monitoring of use of service
• integrate monitoring into resources that implement service
• monitoring should allow to correct identification of user during each use of service

23. What are good practices to monitor the consumption of subscription-based IT services?
• charged at fixed rate
• keep an inventory for each service
• the inventory may be part of the operational system

21 business-IT alignment
1. For each of the descriptions below, identify the concept that is being defined:
• The degree to which the IT mission, objectives, and plans support and are supported by the business
mission, objectives and plans
business-IT alignment
• The proper governance of the IT function in accordance with the requirements of the business and the
proper use of IT capabilities in the business
business-IT alignment
• In the strategic impact grid of Nolan and McFarlan (2005), the mode where organizations have little need
for innovation and but high need for reliability
factory mode
• In the strategic impact grid of Nolan and McFarlan (2005), the mode where IT often represents a minor
cost and organizations are usually technological followers, implementing standard IT systems
support mode
• In the Strategic Alignment Model, the perspective where the business strategy is the driving force and
the IT infrastructure follows from the organizational infrastructure
strategy execution
• The perspective of the Strategic Alignment Model, mainly used by business that envisage technological
leadership. This perspective does not consider the organizational infrastructure
technology transformation
• The perspective of the Strategic Alignment Model, suited to businesses that want to leverage technology
to gain a competitive advantage. Alignment in this perspective is driven by the IT strategy.
competetive potential
• In the Strategic Alignment Model, the perspective that aims at achieving excellent IT service delivery.
This approach essentially ignores the business strategy.
service level
• In the alignment model of Weill & Broadbent (1998), this context is concerned with the business products
and markets, the customers and the investment
strategic context

12. What are the four strategic focus points, important for business-IT alignment? Give typical
characteristics of organizations, adopting each of the focus points.
• financial focus
– organizations focus on low costs and high return on investment
– IT focused on financial management aspects
• operational focus
– organizations focus on high operational efficiency, governance and compliance
– IT focused on high degree of automation of business processes
• product focus
– organizations develop, market and sell products with high value they continuously innovate with
regard to their products, aiming at differentiating them from competition
– IT focused on support of product development and sales processes
• customer focus

13. Give general guidelines for IT management for an organization adopting the financial strategic
focus point.
• Implements strict cost management
• Strict rules for IT funding
• Relation IT funding requirements management
• Closely monitored purchasing and supplier management
14. Give general guidelines for IT management for an organization adopting the operational
strategic focus point.

17. Discuss the four quadrants of the strategic attitude of organizations towards IT. What are
the dimensions of the diagram and briefly explain the relation between the business and IT in
each of the quadrants.
Figure 18: Strategic attitude of organizations towards IT.
18. Enterprise architecture can have three different purposes. Briefly describe these purposes.
• building: the architected systems will be designed and built
• communication: the enterprise model serves as a communication tool, usually between the business and
IT by presenting a model that can be understood both by business management and IT
• documentation: the enterprise model documents existing systems
19. Explain why and how enterprise architecture is valuable for business-IT alignment.
Enterprise architecture articulates the links between business and IT:
• it contains information on how business processes are supported by applications
• it provides data structures at business level
20. The operating model of an organization has a profound influence on the enterprise architecture
and therefore on business-IT alignment. Ross et al. (2006) developed a quadrant with four
operating models. Describe their quadrant: what are the dimensions and what are the properties
of the four different quadrants?
Figure 19: The operating model by Ross et al.
21. Describe the four stages of architectural maturity.
1. business silos
• low level of business-IT alignment
• local alignment only (per business unit)
• no global alignment efforts
2. standardized technology
46
• full business-IT alignment on infrastructure level
• some effort towards global alignment
• (highest level for diversification operating model)
3. optimized core
• global business-IT alignment
4. business modularity
• agility on top of global business-IT alignment
• combination of ‘local’ and ‘global’ alignment
22. Which are the most important IT management processes and activities, contributing to
business-IT alignment?
23. Explain how the Luftman model measures business-IT alignment.
It uses a 4-step approach with 38 criteria and 5 maturity levels.
24. The Luftman model evaluates 38 criteria according to a model with maturity levels. Describe
these maturity levels.
1. ad hoc process
• Lowest level
• Minimal awareness
• Alignment is improbable
2. committed process
• Commitment to begin
• Still minimal awareness
3. established process
• Focused alignment awareness
• IT embedded into business
• IT used throughout enterprise
4. improved process
• Effective governance
• IT considered valuable, innovative, contributing to business
5. optima process
• Governance mature
• Integration IT strategic plan into business plan
• IT used in supply chain
25. The Luftman model recommends conducting a business-IT alignment assessment in four
steps. Briefly describe these steps.
1. form an assessment team
• Typically 10 to 30 executives of investigated organization
• Both business and IT
2. gather information
47
• Team members evaluate criteria, giving maturity level
• Scores are discussed
3. decide on scores of each criterion
• Agreement on average scores for each criterion
• Calculation of average for each of the six categories
4. decide on overall alignment score
• Total score = average over six categories
• Discussion and agreement on total score
